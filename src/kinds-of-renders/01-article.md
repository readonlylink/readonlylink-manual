title: Article
---

We render `Article` using [readonly.link/articles](https://readonly.link/articles).

Just a link to a Markdown file.

We can set attributes of a Markdown file at the front of the file,
like the following.

- It is optional but recommend to set the `title` attribute.

``` yaml
---
title: My Article
---

Content of my article.
```
